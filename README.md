Understanding core programming concepts and why they are used is just as important as knowing how to write code. New programmers need to learn to bridge the gap and to connect the theory to practice. In this course, Barron Stone and Olivia Chui Stone illustrate programming concepts in Python by relating them to real-life objects, actions, and scenarios. Each video focuses on a different analogy that demonstrates the concepts in code. Join Barron and Olivia as they take you through a typical Saturday and use regular tasks and errands—and even ordering pizza—to explain functions, objects, queues, sets, loops, and other programming constructs.
